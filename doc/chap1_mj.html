<h3>1 <span class="Heading">Introduction to <strong class="pkg">Vole</strong></span></h3>

<p><strong class="pkg">Vole</strong> is a <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> <a href="chapBib_mj.html#biBGAP4">[GAP21]</a> package. The purpose of this manual is to describe the capabilities of <strong class="pkg">Vole</strong>, and to give directions, hints, and explanations about its use.</p>

<p><strong class="pkg">Vole</strong> is a very general framework. The easiest way to learn about the capabilities of <strong class="pkg">Vole</strong> is by reading the tutorial (Chapter <a href="chap3_mj.html#X81932F777898AD72"><span class="RefLink">3</span></a>), to see a number of worked examples.</p>

<p>In this manual, a <em>permutation</em> is defined on the set of all positive integers, but moves only finitely many points. Unless otherwise stated, a <em>group</em> is a finite permutation group (which, by the definition of a permutation, necessarily has a finite set of moved points); and a <em>coset</em> is a left or right coset of such a group determined by some permutation.</p>

<p>In full generality, <strong class="pkg">Vole</strong> can be used to find permutations (groups given by strong generating sets, cosets thereof, or individual representative elements) that satisfy conjunctions of particular kinds of properties, or <em>constraints</em>; details of these properties are given later. Problems that can be formulated in this way include, for example, the computation of normalisers, set stabilisers, subgroup intersections, and graph automorphisms, and testing subgroup conjugacy and graph isomorphism.</p>

<p><strong class="pkg">Vole</strong> can also compute canonical labellings and images (also known as ‘canonical forms’) of various kinds of objects under an action of an arbitrary permutation group. This includes, for example, the canonical image of a digraph under the natural action of an arbitrary permutation group, or the canonical image of a permutation group under conjugation by another. <em>As far as we are aware, most of this canonical image functionality is not possible with existing tools</em>.</p>

<p>In order to offer all of this functionality, <strong class="pkg">Vole</strong> implements the <em>graph backtracking</em> framework, which was introduced in <a href="chapBib_mj.html#biBGBpublished">[JPWW21]</a>, and which generalises the <em>partition backtracking</em> framework of Jeffrey Leon <a href="chapBib_mj.html#biBLeon1991">[Leo91]</a>, <a href="chapBib_mj.html#biBLeon1997">[Leo97]</a>. The functionality for canonical labellings and canonical images is underpinned, in addition, by work that is in preparation for publication, and which builds on <a href="chapBib_mj.html#biBMinimalCanonical">[JJPW19]</a>.</p>

<p>While the <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> interface of this package is written in <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong>, the main algorithms are written in Rust, for reasons of fun and performance.</p>

<h4>1.1 <span class="Heading">High level overview of <strong class="pkg">Vole</strong> and this manual</span></h4>

<p><strong class="pkg">Vole</strong> aims to provide a high-performance implementation of the graph backtracking framework of <a href="chapBib_mj.html#biBGBpublished">[JPWW21]</a>, <a href="chapBib_mj.html#biBGBextended">[JPWW19]</a>.</p>

<p>Graph backtracking is a form of depth-first backtrack search that can be performed in a finite symmetric group, and which uses labelled digraphs to represent various aspects of the problem at hand in order to guide the search and prune the search space. The specification of the problem is given by a collection of <em>constraints</em>, and a collection of <em>refiners</em> are used to prune the search according to those constraints.</p>

<p>The rest of this introduction discusses the place of <strong class="pkg">Vole</strong> in the <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> ‘ecosystem’, and gives information about its ongoing development. Installation instructions for <strong class="pkg">Vole</strong> are given in Chapter <a href="chap2_mj.html#X7DB9E92F7B9E3031"><span class="RefLink">2</span></a>, and Chapter <a href="chap3_mj.html#X81932F777898AD72"><span class="RefLink">3</span></a> gives a tutorial for the package. Chapter <a href="chap4_mj.html#X7C9C24D97DB3662F"><span class="RefLink">4</span></a> describes an interface to <strong class="pkg">Vole</strong> that emulates the existing related functionality of <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> and its packages. Chapter <a href="chap5_mj.html#X8722B8157E8CAB1D"><span class="RefLink">5</span></a> documents the main interface to <strong class="pkg">Vole</strong>. Chapter <a href="chap6_mj.html#X79EAB456814AB11C"><span class="RefLink">6</span></a> describes the constraints that can be used with <strong class="pkg">Vole</strong>, while Chapter <a href="chap7_mj.html#X7846B7A27DCCAAB3"><span class="RefLink">7</span></a> explains refiners, and gives details of those that are available. Chapter <a href="chap8_mj.html#X85AB4D7A8774546F"><span class="RefLink">8</span></a> gives lower-level details, and instructions for the expert use of <strong class="pkg">Vole</strong>.</p>

<p>If you encounter problems, or have any other feedback for the authors, then please <span class="URL"><a href="https://github.com/peal/vole/issues">create an issue on our issue tracker</a></span>, or contact us by any other appropriate means. See the <a href="../../../pkg/vole/doc/chap0_mj.html#X7D2C85EC87DD46E5"><span class="RefLink">title page</span></a> of this manual for our contact details. We published <strong class="pkg">Vole</strong> so that our ideas and algorithms could be used by, and be useful to, others in the community. But without feedback, it can be difficult to know whether we are achieving this aim. Therefore we are keen to hear your comments, remarks, and complaints.</p>

<h4>1.2 <span class="Heading"><strong class="pkg">Vole</strong>'s relation to <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> and its other packages</span></h4>

<p>The functionality of <strong class="pkg">Vole</strong> overlaps with that of <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> itself, and some of its packages. However, <strong class="pkg">Vole</strong>'s functionality goes further than all of them, and has the potential to offer better performance in many cases where there is an overlap. The perfomance of <strong class="pkg">Vole</strong> is discussed in Section <a href="chap1_mj.html#X854F8C5579845066"><span class="RefLink">1.4</span></a>.</p>

<p><strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> <em>itself</em></p>

<p><strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> <a href="chapBib_mj.html#biBGAP4">[GAP21]</a> contains an implementation of Jeffrey Leon's partition backtrack framework <a href="chapBib_mj.html#biBLeon1991">[Leo91]</a>, <a href="chapBib_mj.html#biBLeon1997">[Leo97]</a> at the <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> level, as improved upon by Heiko Theißen <a href="chapBib_mj.html#biBTheissen">[The97]</a>. Therefore <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> already offers some of the functionality that <strong class="pkg">Vole</strong> provides; the overlap is explored further in Section <a href="chap4_mj.html#X800CAA4182BAB6D7"><span class="RefLink">4.4</span></a>.</p>

<p><strong class="pkg">ferret</strong></p>

<p>Christopher Jefferson's <strong class="pkg">ferret</strong> package <a href="chapBib_mj.html#biBferret">[Jef21]</a> for <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> provides a C++ reimplementation of partition backtracking, which contains the orbital graph developments of <a href="chapBib_mj.html#biBNewRefiners">[JPW19]</a>. <strong class="pkg">Vole</strong> should be seen as the spiritual successor to <strong class="pkg">ferret</strong>.</p>

<p><strong class="pkg">images</strong></p>

<p>The <strong class="pkg">images</strong> package <a href="chapBib_mj.html#biBimages">[JJPW21]</a> provides a <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong>-level implementation of the custom breadth-first search that was introduced in <a href="chapBib_mj.html#biBMinimalCanonical">[JJPW19]</a> to compute the <em>canonical image</em> of any set of points under the action of an arbitrary permutation group. This algorithm built upon the original algorithm of Steve Linton <a href="chapBib_mj.html#biBLinton">[Lin04]</a> for computing <em>minimal images</em> of sets of points, which is available in the <strong class="pkg">GRAPE</strong> package <a href="chapBib_mj.html#biBGRAPE">[Soi21]</a> in <span class="URL"><a href="https://github.com/gap-packages/grape/blob/master/lib/smallestimage.g"><code class="file">lib/smallestimage.g</code></a></span>, as <code class="code">SmallestImageSet</code>. The overlap of <strong class="pkg">Vole</strong>'s functionality with <strong class="pkg">images</strong> is detailed in Section <a href="chap4_mj.html#X7A2FDAA7838D97A1"><span class="RefLink">4.5</span></a>.</p>

<p><strong class="pkg">Digraphs</strong> <em>and</em> <strong class="pkg">GRAPE</strong></p>

<p>The <strong class="pkg">Digraphs</strong> package <a href="chapBib_mj.html#biBDigraphs">[BJM+21]</a> offers interfaces to <strong class="pkg">nauty</strong> <a href="chapBib_mj.html#biBnauty">[MP14]</a> (via the <strong class="pkg">NautyTracesInterface</strong>) and <strong class="pkg">bliss</strong> <a href="chapBib_mj.html#biBbliss">[JK07]</a> for computing automorphism groups and canonical images of graphs and digraphs, and their labelled variants. The overlap of <strong class="pkg">Vole</strong>'s functionality with <strong class="pkg">Digraphs</strong> is detailed in Section <a href="chap4_mj.html#X7E533E72831AC20B"><span class="RefLink">4.6</span></a>. <strong class="pkg">GRAPE</strong> <a href="chapBib_mj.html#biBGRAPE">[Soi21]</a> also provides an interface to <strong class="pkg">nauty</strong> for computing automorphism groups of graphs, and computing canonical images of graphs in the symmetric group.</p>

<p><strong class="pkg">BacktrackKit</strong> <em>and</em> <strong class="pkg">GraphBacktracking</strong></p>

<p><strong class="pkg">BacktrackKit</strong> <a href="chapBib_mj.html#biBBacktrackKit">[JW21a]</a> and <strong class="pkg">GraphBacktracking</strong> <a href="chapBib_mj.html#biBGraphBacktracking">[JW21b]</a> contain <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong>-level reference implementations of partition backtracking and graph backtracking, respectively. They are intended to demonstrate readable code implementing these frameworks, but they are not intended to have high performance, and they are deliberately not optimized.</p>

<p><a id="X78971F3A7930451A" name="X78971F3A7930451A"></a></p>

<h4>1.3 <span class="Heading">Work in progress</span></h4>

<p><strong class="pkg">Vole</strong> is a work in progress – the code and its underlying mathematical theory are being developed concurrently. Therefore, some aspects of <strong class="pkg">Vole</strong> are liable to change in future versions, although we will aim to maintain the primary interfaces as described in Chapters <a href="chap4_mj.html#X7C9C24D97DB3662F"><span class="RefLink">4</span></a>, <a href="chap5_mj.html#X8722B8157E8CAB1D"><span class="RefLink">5</span></a>, and <a href="chap6_mj.html#X79EAB456814AB11C"><span class="RefLink">6</span></a>. However, some of the lower-level details described in Sections <a href="chap7_mj.html#X7846B7A27DCCAAB3"><span class="RefLink">7</span></a> and <a href="chap8_mj.html#X85AB4D7A8774546F"><span class="RefLink">8</span></a> are more likely change.</p>

<p>The main focus of our future work on <strong class="pkg">Vole</strong> will be on improving the performance of <strong class="pkg">Vole</strong>, through both technical and mathematical means. This may involve changes to the design of the algorithm itself, and the improvement or addition of refiners, especially for subgroup normalisers and conjugacy. See Section <a href="chap1_mj.html#X854F8C5579845066"><span class="RefLink">1.4</span></a> for further comments on the performance of <strong class="pkg">Vole</strong>.</p>

<p><a id="X854F8C5579845066" name="X854F8C5579845066"></a></p>

<h4>1.4 <span class="Heading">Performance</span></h4>

<p>Our aims are for <strong class="pkg">Vole</strong> to have good performance in general, and to have relatively high performance for some classes of problems that existing tools tend to find very difficult. As mentioned in Section <a href="chap1_mj.html#X78971F3A7930451A"><span class="RefLink">1.3</span></a>, we are still working towards these aims.</p>

<p><em>If you encounter disappointing and/or surprising performance for your use-case, please let us know,</em> by <span class="URL"><a href="https://github.com/peal/vole/issues">creating an issue on our issue tracker</a></span>, or contacting us by any other appropriate means. See the title page of this manual for our contact details. This will help us to improve <strong class="pkg">Vole</strong>.</p>

<p>The experiments in <a href="chapBib_mj.html#biBGBpublished">[JPWW21]</a> showed that for some classes of problems, graph backtracking typically performs a far smaller search than does partition backtracking. Although this experimental data is very encouraging, it is clearly inherently more expensive to compute with graphs than it is to compute with ordered partitions. This means that the time gained by having a smaller number of nodes in a search does not necessarily immediately outweigh the time required to perform a larger amount of computation at each node. Therefore, in rough terms, the focus of future work is on reducing the number of search nodes further (with more sophisticated refiners), and reducing the amount of work required at each node of search (with technical optimisations).</p>

<p>Where there is overlap between <strong class="pkg">Vole</strong> and existing functionality in the <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> ecosystem, as described in Section <a href="chap1_mj.html#X8551085685C27DF0"><span class="RefLink">1.2</span></a>, we aim for <strong class="pkg">Vole</strong> to perform reasonably competitively.</p>

<p>However, roughly speaking, there are certain problems that can be represented by ordered partitions just as well as they can by graphs. In these cases, it follows that there is nothing to be gained by using graph backtracking, while the additional overhead required by graph backtracking may make it slower overall. <strong class="pkg">Vole</strong> does not yet attempt to mitigate this issue. For example, we do not yet expect <strong class="pkg">Vole</strong> to match the performance of <strong class="pkg">nauty</strong> (available through the <strong class="pkg">Digraphs</strong> and <strong class="pkg">GRAPE</strong> packages) at computing automorphisms of graphs, and canonical images of graphs in a symmetric group.</p>

<p>In addition, we do not expect <strong class="pkg">Vole</strong> to beat <strong class="pkg">images</strong> at computing canonical images of sets in groups.</p>

<p>There are further reasons why existing implementations may beat the current version of <strong class="pkg">Vole</strong>, in some situations.</p>


<ul>
<li><p><em>Very few special cases:</em> <strong class="pkg">Vole</strong> passes almost every problem that it receives on to the full graph backtracking algorithm, with its corresponding overheads and poor worst-case complexity. On the other hand, other implementations (particularly those in the <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> library) may provide multiple competing methods for solving a problem. Some of these methods might only apply in special cases (such as for simple groups, or abelian group, or primitive groups), and some of them might not even involve search at all. From these different methods, the system can use heuristics to choose the most appropriate one to run in each instance.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><p><em>First-time compilation of Vole:</em> When the first <strong class="pkg">Vole</strong> search is executed in any particular <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> session, <strong class="pkg">Vole</strong> tests whether its Rust component is compiled, and it builds the component if necessary. The check itself can take a noticeable amount of time, but compilation takes much longer. To minimise the effect, we recommend that you manually recompile <strong class="pkg">Vole</strong> when you update your <strong class="pkg">Vole</strong> installation via the <code class="code">make</code> command, as described in Section <a href="chap2_mj.html#X7BB03C16800B014E"><span class="RefLink">2.2</span></a>.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Communication between the GAP layer and the Rust component:</em> There is also a delay that is incurred when the <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong>-level interface of <strong class="pkg">Vole</strong> communicates with the Rust component of <strong class="pkg">Vole</strong>. This is exacerbated by the fact that <strong class="pkg">Vole</strong> does not yet include its own Rust-level implementation of stabiliser chains, and so it uses <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong>'s stabiliser chains instead. This means that <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> and the Rust component must communicate heavily during a typical search, and this can incur a significant time penalty. Implementing Rust-level stabiliser chains is a work in progress.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Fortune:</em> The nature of backtrack search means that one algorithm may beat another just by being ‘lucky’, and (by chance) stumbling upon particularly fruitful branches early in search. Conversely, an algorithm may be ‘unlucky’ and fall down a particular unfruitful branch that a different algorithm accidentally avoids.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>These factors together highlight the principle that, for users for whom performance is very important, it makes sense to experiment with the range of available tools when running computations.</p>

<p>Please also make sure that you are running the newest version of <strong class="pkg">Vole</strong>, since newer versions should have better performance.</p>
